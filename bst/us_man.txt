Hey, there!
This "C" code implements binary search tree from a begginers perspective.

There is three different functions to do basic operations on bst's.
You can add new child's to the root node that you've created.

You can find any node you want, also the code will tell you which side to go
in order to find the desired child.
 
Also, don't worry! The code is completely "segmentation-fault"-free. :)
